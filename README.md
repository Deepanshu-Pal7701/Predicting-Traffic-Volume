Bangalore Traffic Volume Prediction
This project uses machine learning to predict traffic volume in different areas of Bangalore based on weather, time, and infrastructure-related data. The model leverages a Random Forest Regressor to estimate vehicle volume and provides insights through visualizations and area-specific predictions.

📌 Features
Predict traffic volume based on:

Area name

Date and time (month, weekday)

Environmental factors

Public transport usage

Weather conditions (Clear, Fog, Overcast)

Data visualization: feature importance and actual vs predicted scatter plot

Interactive area-based prediction with real-time input

Intelligent suggestions if area name input is misspelled

Clean, scalable and well-commented code

🧠 Technologies Used
Python 3

pandas – Data loading and processing

matplotlib, seaborn – Visualization

scikit-learn – Machine learning and preprocessing

difflib – Approximate string matching for user input

📁 Dataset
The dataset includes features such as:

Traffic Volume

Average Speed

Travel Time Index

Congestion Level

Road Capacity Utilization

Environmental Impact

Public Transport Usage

Weather Conditions

Area Name and Date
